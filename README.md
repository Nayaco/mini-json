# An Utility Lib for better C++

This library is written in C++17, which means you need use the latest  `gcc/clang`. I didn't make sure it can run on `MSVC`, so you'd better use `gcc/clang`.

You could see this library like some kind of parse for `stdlib` . But it makes you needn't worry about  some basic conventions.:joy_cat: 

### 1.Basic API

+ to
+ Reflect.regObject
+ Reflect.getObject
+ Reflect.getInstance[*static*]

### 2. Some Conventions

The first parameter of all functions send to the `Instance` or `to` should be an `ERRCODE` refrence.

And! Nothing else. :smile:
